# HEC-HMS Self Project of salsipuedes creek
- It is a simple HEC-HMS model to simulate a flood event during February 2017 at Salsipuedes Creek near Lompoc, CA. 
- This is a simple hydrologic model, calibrated the model to observed streamflow using gridded precipitation.

 ## Following Steps were followed:  
- Download Streamflow Data
- Delineate Modeling Elements Using HEC-HMS GIS Tools
- Parameterize the Subbasin Element
- Add Streamflow and Precipitation Data to the Project
- Calibrate the Model
- Document Final Model Parameters
